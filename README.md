# Hydrostatic Equilibrium of uniformly rotating cylindrical polytropes

A detailed analysis of how to track the surface of cylindrical polytropes.

### Numerical Method

The method with wich the problem is solved is the cassical 4th-order Runge-Kutta.

### Construct your polytrope

[Constructing different polytropes by setting b (rotation) and polytropic index n](https://github.com/asasli/HE_Cyl/blob/master/Hydrostatic%20Equilibrium%20(rotating%20cylindrical%20polytrope).ipynb). 

Tip: Be aware that if you exceed the maximum value for rotation the code won't stop running since the radius is "infinity" in such cases.
