# Hydrostatic Equilibrium for uniformly rotating cylindrical polytropes

A detailed analysis of how to track the surface of cylindrical polytropes.

### Numerical Method

The method with wich the problem is solved is the cassical 4th-order Runge-Kutta.

### Construct

Constructing different polytropes by setting b (rotation) and polytropic index n. 

Tip: Be aware that if you exceed the maximum value for rotation the code won't stop running since the star has "infinity" radius in such cases.
